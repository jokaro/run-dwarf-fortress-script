# Run Dwarf Fortress Script

Use this script to launch dfhack with PyLNP without getting `"x-x: unexpected operator"`. This script will not lock PyLNP and allow you to launch utlities like Dwarf Therapist.

Download the **run.py** file from this repository and add it to your **df_linux** folder.

In PyLNP open **File** -> **Configure terminal...** and add the following in the text box.
> `python run.py $` 

Requirements

* Python 2.7.x
